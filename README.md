# neo is a [personal / community] cli template manager.

Currently there is only zustand & typescript & react native starter.


## FAQ

#### Why would i need a starter?

In some scenarios there might be version conflicts, for example react native's lots of dependencies' LTS versions are not compatible eachother. In order to maintain project balance, you need to find best matches for their versionr.
> Another example:  react-native version 1.0.0 may not be compatible with react-navigation 2.0.0 
> Which is very common in mobile development with react native.

#### Again why would i need a starer or this cli?

Simple answer; You don't, i have just created a stable starter template to save time. Saving time from finding exact matches of dependencies without any kind of error. Basically you can clone this repository and copy the files in templates folder or you may follow the cli if you are doing some testing with different projects.
